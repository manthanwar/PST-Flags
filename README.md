# PST-Flags
LaTeX package for drawing flags of countries using PSTricks


## Introduction
This document is a reference manual for the \texttt{pst-flags} package. The package and the user manual is available at [ctan archive](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/pst-flags).

### About pst-flags
This package provides macros for rendering flags and associated artefacts drawn using LaTeX PSTricks package. This package further contributes towards a complete implementation of the vector drawing capabilities provided by PSTricks. Formatting of the resulting drawings is entirely controlled by TeX macros. A good working knowledge of LaTeX should be sufficient to design flags and draw the new ones. Features such as color or shape customisation and dynamic modifications are possible by cleverly adjusting the properties and parameters arguments of the options supplied to TeX macros, see the documentation for examples.
